    Version: 3.0.5

    Receive events over HTTP.
    -------------------------

        **Receive events over HTTP.**

        An HTTP server mapping URL endpoints to queues to which events can be
        submitted.

        Mapping queues to endpoints::

            Connecting queues to this module automatically maps them to the equivalent
            URL endpoint.

            The "/" endpoint is by default mapped to the <outbox> queue.


        Authentication and authorization behavior::

            - The htpasswd and resource file content override any duplicate entries
              defined in ``resource`` and ``htpasswd``.
            - Htpasswd is evaluated first before token validation.
            - You cannot define htpasswd and token authentication on the same
              resource definition.
            - Loading multiple htpasswd and resource files is supported.  The
              order of loading determines the priority.

        Htpasswd and resource file loading behavior::

            - Events submitted to queue '_htpasswd' should have the event payload
              generated by wishbone.module.input.inotify.
            - Events submitted to queue '_resource' should have the event payload
              generated by wishbone.module.input.inotify.
            - Files are removed from cache using ``IN_DELETE_SELF`` events.
            - Files are loaded/updated to cache using ``WISHBONE_INIT`` and
              ``IN_CLOSE_WRITE`` events.

        Available meta data::

            Each event has some meta associated stored in tmp.<instance_name>
